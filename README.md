# The Enchiridion

The Enchiridion is a website containing articles I have written on topics within maths, computer science, physics, and artifical intelligence. The articles are typically not basic tutorials, but rather, discussion of interesting theory such as SLT (singular learning theory). The website serves two purposes: firstly, to help other people learn, and secondly, so I have a record of the things I have studied. 

Please contact me if there are any issues with the website or if you have any questions about the article.
