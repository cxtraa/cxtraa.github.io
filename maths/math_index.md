# Mathematics

This section discusses the field of mathematics, typically with a physics or machine learning focus. For example, in my article on chaos theory, I spend a great deal of time discussing the physical consequences of the theory and its connections to information theory. The motivation for this is to give the reader a clear understanding of why we should even care about the theory presented.
