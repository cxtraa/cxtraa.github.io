# Computer science

Computer science is a fascinating and extremely broad topic. It encompasses a range of topics, from web and game development, to algorithm analysis and information theory. Articles on computer science will typically either be long tutorials (for example, on how to develop a simple game in C++ and OpenGL), or short-form articles discussing a core concept in computer science (for example, data structures such as a binary tree or a priority queue).
