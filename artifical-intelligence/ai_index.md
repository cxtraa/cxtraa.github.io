# Artifical intelligence

Here you can find a range of articles on the exciting topic of AI and machine learning. These articles usually contain *code implementations* of the topics being discussed. For example, I have a tutorial on transformers, which covers the theory and offers Python implementations of all the described classes. The codes provided are generally only in *Python*, which is the typical language of choice for machine learning.
