# Physics

Physics was my main passion prior to studying artifical intelligence. I like to view physics through the lens of problem-solving - and so my articles will often be discussing some interesting physics problem, such as the three-body problem, rather than explaining theory and derivations which can be found online anyways in any good physics textbook. Prior to joining the University of Cambridge, I was involved with the BPhO (British Physics Olympiad) and eventually was selected as reserve for the UK IPhO (International Physics Olympiad) team, being ranked 6th in the UK at the time.
