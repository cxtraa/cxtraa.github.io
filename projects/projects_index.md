# ML Research and Projects

I detail my machine learning projects and research here. This includes small web apps I've built to demonstrate a model, or theoretical research I've published papers on (such as my paper: [NGD converges to less degenerate solutions than SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04913) on arXiv).
