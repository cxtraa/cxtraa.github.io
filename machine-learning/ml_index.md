# Machine learning

These articles range from pure theory (like my article on singular learning theory), to tutorials that are almost completely implementation based. Machine learning is an exciting field where a great deal of research is happening; I'm interested in how we can apply intuition from physics and information theory to better understand how and why neural networks generalise.
