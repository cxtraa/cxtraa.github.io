## About

The website is authored by myself, Moosa Saghir, an undergraduate student studying Engineering at the University of Cambridge. My background has traditionally been in physics and engineering - I was reserve for the IPhO in 2023, and prior to that I was part of an F1 in Schools team named ELECTRON which represented the UK at the World Finals. 

Currently, I am conducting research with CAISH (Cambridge AI Safety Hub) into singular learning theory (SLT), a novel theory which explains that neural networks generalise because gradient descent algorithms like SGD favour *less complex minima* reducing the generalisation loss. Our research focuses on empirically testing the claims of SLT, namely that models converge to less complex solutions.
